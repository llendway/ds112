This tutorial introduces some common import functions, illustrates basic web scraping with `rvest`, shows how to create nice tables with `gt`, and how to combine graphs with `patchwork`.

By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

* Import data into R that is stored in a common file type (.csv, .txt, excel, etc) or in a Google spreadsheet.  

* Find resources to read in data that is in a format other than one of the more common formats.

* Use `rvest()` functions to scrape data from a simple webpage and recognize when scraping the data will require more advanced tools.

* Create nice tables with the `gt` functions. 

* Use `patchwork` to display related plots together nicely.
