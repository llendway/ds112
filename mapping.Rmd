This tutorial introduces a few different ways to map data in R.

By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

* Plot data points on top of a map using the `ggmap()` function along with `ggplot2` functions.  

* Create choropleth maps using `geom_map()`.  

* Add points and other `ggplot2` features to a map created from `geom_map()`.  

* Understand the basics of creating a map using `leaflet`, including adding points and choropleths to a base map.
