This tutorial introduces joining, pivoting, factor variable manipulation, and basic string manipulation with `stringr`.

By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

* Use `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`to change the way the data are laid out.  
* Join tables of data together using the `dplyr` join functions and understand the differences among the different types of joins.  
* Use various `forcats` functions, including ones not covered in the tutorial, to change the order or values of levels of categorical variables.  
* Use the `stringr` functions covered in this tutorial (plus `separate()`) and know where to find information about other `stringr` functions (HINT: the cheatsheet is a great start).
