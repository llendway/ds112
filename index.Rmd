This website serves the students who take COMP/STAT 112 at Macalester College taught by Lisa Lendway. Other people interested in learning Data Science skills using R may also be interested in this material!

To get started, I recommend going through this [R Basics](https://r-basics.netlify.app/) document. If you have used R and R Studio before, there may be some things you can skip. If you are brand new to R and R Studio or it has been a while since you've used it, read and watch carefully.

Once you have done that, visit the Tutorials tab!
