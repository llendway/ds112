This tutorial introduces a few different ways to add animation and interactivity to plots created from `ggplot2`. It will also introduce you to `shiny` apps.

By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

* Add basic interactivity to a `ggplot2` plot using `ggplotly()`.  

* Add animation layers to plots using `gganimate` functions.  

* Create a shiny app that requires inputs.  

* Publish a shiny app to shinyapps.io.
