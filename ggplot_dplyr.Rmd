This tutorial introduced the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages, which are part of the `tidyverse`. It is broken into two sections, the first focuses on plotting with `ggplot()` and the second focuses an using the 6 main `dplyr` verbs or functions.

By the end of the tutorial, you should be able to:

* Construct the "Five Named Graphs" using `ggplot2` functions.  
* Add labels to graphs.  
* Change the theme of a graph.  
* Interpret or explain the graph you created.  
* Use the six main `dplyr` functions to begin "wrangling" data.  
* Pipe (`%>%`) together a sequence of `dplyr` functions to answer a question.  
* Combine `dplyr` verbs and `ggplot()` functions to wrangle and plot data.
